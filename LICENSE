SPYER FOR BUKKIT

By viewing, modifying or redistributing any parts of the code you agree to the following:
1) These changes should be shared unless the derivative is for private use - that means it will not be published anywhere.
2) You will not claim any parts of this application (and any sourcecode) as your own.
3) If you make a public fork of the Spyer package, you MUST provide a link to the parent branch - so if a dog forks Spyer under the name SpyerWoof, the dog will need to provide a link to Spyer in a visible location. If a cat forks SpyerWoof, the cat will have to provide a link to SpyerWoof.
